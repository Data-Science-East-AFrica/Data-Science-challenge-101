<b> 1). Predicting Fuel Efficiency of the Vehicle: </b>

You are required to perform and document all the your processes, from data collection to deploying machine learning Model Using FastAPI.

<b>  1). Data Collection. </b>

You are supposed to use the Classic Auto MPG dataset available at UCI ML Repository, Download the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg)


<b> 2). Define Problem Statement </b>

Frame your question based on description and initial exploration.

<b>  3). Exploratory Data Analysis </b>

Carry out exploratory data analysis to figure out the important features and creating new combination of features.

<b> 4). Data Preparation. </b>

Create a pipe line of tasks  to transform the data to be loaded in our machine learning models

<b> 5). Selecting and Training Machine Learning Models </b>

Train a few machine learning models to evaluate their predictions using cross validation.

<b> 6). Hyperparameters Tuning </b>

Fine tune the hyperparameters for the models that showed promising results.

<b> 7). Deploy your Machine learnig Model using web service.</b>

Deploy your model using FastAPI and Docker on Heroku.
